### zsh-best-practices v1.2.0

Updated naming conventions to follow industry standards (POSIX, Google Shell Style Guide, Oh My Zsh) instead of custom conventions.

#### Changed

  - Regular variables: `lowercase_snake_case` (was `Mixed_Snake_Case`)
  - Constants & exports: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (unchanged)
  - Private variables: `_leading_underscore` (unchanged)
  - Removed non-standard `CamelCase` recommendation for local variables
- **Function naming conventions** updated to industry standards:
  - Public functions: `lowercase_with_underscores` (was `lowerfirst_Snake_Case`)
  - Private functions: `_lowercase_with_underscores` (was `_lowerfirst_Snake_Case`)
- Updated SKILL.md examples to use industry-standard naming
  - Script template now uses `script_dir`, `tmp_dir` instead of `ScriptDir`, `TmpDir`
  - Added rule: "If it's your variable, lowercase it. If you export it or it's a constant, uppercase it."
- Updated references/01-naming-conventions.md with comprehensive industry standard documentation
  - Added POSIX standard references
  - Added Google Shell Style Guide references
  - Removed custom `Mixed_Snake_Case` convention

**Context**: Previous conventions were based on custom patterns. New conventions match 99% of shell scripts in the wild (Linux kernel, Oh My Zsh, Google's codebase).

**Impact**: Skills developed using this guide now follow widely-recognized conventions, making them more recognizable to other developers.
