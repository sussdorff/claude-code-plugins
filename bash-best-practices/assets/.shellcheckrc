# This file configures ShellCheck to align with this skill's guidelines

# Specify shell dialect (always bash for this skill)
shell=bash

# Disable specific checks that conflict with pragmatic practices

# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source
# Reason: Dynamic sourcing is sometimes necessary
disable=SC1090

# SC1091: Not following sourced file
# Reason: Files may not exist during linting (generated at runtime)
disable=SC1091

# SC2312: Consider invoking this command separately to avoid masking return values
# Reason: Sometimes intentional for cleaner code when error is not critical
# Note: Enable this in strict contexts by removing from this list
# disable=SC2312

# Enable optional checks for better quality

# SC2250: Prefer putting braces around variable references even when not strictly required
enable=quote-safe-variables

# SC2251: This pattern may not have expected results
enable=check-unassigned-uppercase

# Set severity threshold (error, warning, info, style)
# Comment out to see all levels
# severity=warning

# External sources to check (paths relative to script being checked)
# external-sources=true

# Source path for following source/. commands
# source-path=SCRIPTDIR

# Notes on common suppressions:
# - Suppress inline with: # shellcheck disable=SC####
# - Suppress for line with: # shellcheck disable=SC#### (comment on line before)
# - Suppress for file with: # shellcheck disable=SC#### (at top of file)
# - Always document WHY you're suppressing
